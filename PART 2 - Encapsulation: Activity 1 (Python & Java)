# Answer in 1: To prevent direct access and protect the balance from being changed outside the class.
# Answer in 2: It raises an AttributeError because __balance is name-mangled and not directly accessible.


// JAVA

class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 0;

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.deposit(100);
        account.withdraw(30);
        System.out.println(account.getBalance());
    }
}

// Answer in 1: To restrict access and ensure the balance is only modified through controlled methods.
// Answer in 2: The compiler shows an error: balance has private access in BankAccount.
