# Answer in 1: No function is used here — values are manually assigned in the child class.
# Answer in 2: To reuse attributes like brand and fuel from the Vehicle class in Car.


// JAVA

class Vehicle {
    String brand;
    int fuel;
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int doors;

    Car(String brand, int fuel, int doors) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.fuel = fuel;
        this.doors = doors;
    }

    void drive() {
        if (fuel > 0) {
            fuel--;
            System.out.println("Driving...");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Out of fuel!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2, 4);
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.drive();
    }
}


// Answer in 1: No super() is used — values are manually assigned in the constructor.
// Answer in 2: To extend the Vehicle class and add new features like doors and drive() in Car.
