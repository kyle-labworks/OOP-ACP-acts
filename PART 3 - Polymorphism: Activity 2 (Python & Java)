# Answer in 1: If an object has the required method, it can be used — regardless of its type.
# Answer in 2: It raises an error: 'int' object has no attribute 'speak'.



// JAVA

interface Speaker {
    void speak();
}

class Bird implements Speaker {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Tweet!");
    }
}

class Robot implements Speaker {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Beep boop!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Speaker s1 = new Bird();
        Speaker s2 = new Robot();
        s1.speak();
        s2.speak();
    }
}


// Answer in 1: Java doesn’t support duck typing directly; it uses interfaces to define expected behavior.
// Answer in 2: You can't pass an int to a method expecting a class with speak() — it won’t compile.
